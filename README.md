# Family Hub

The purpose of creating this app is to allow families to sync their schedules, chat and leave reminders in one centralized location.

Every day many busy families start their day unprepared or unorganized and must rely on old school reminders such as bound calendars and post it notes.  Many families also have children who don't have a mobile device of their own on which they can see the family calendar or communicate with other family members.  In today’s world it is possible to leverage technology to solve these problems and make our busy lives less stressful.  

Family Hub believes in the five P’s: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.  We have created a Hub for families to not only sync calendars and see the weather forecast, but to have the ability to maintain to-do/grocery lists, white board notes for each other and chat in real-time.  All of this information is available in one convenient place. (We suggest mounting an older model iPad on your fridge.)  

With Family Hub, children who don't have their own devices can go to the family iPad to see the family calendar or chat with other family members. Because we have incorporated the powerful Google Calendar, events can be added to the calendar from any device and the Family Hub calendar is immediately updated. The weather API will request access to the location for accurate up to date weather information but can be changed to show weather in any location. The white board is available for leaving family notes and is complete with an eraser. Any family member can add items to the grocery list or todo list and the family chat room is available for family members to live chat!

Family Hub’s strength is derived from Google Calendar and the Weather.com API and powered by React, CSS/Bootstrap, and NodeJS and Socket.io to provide a single page application hub for your family.

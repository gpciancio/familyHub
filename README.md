# Family Hub

The purpose of creating this app is to solve the problem of families syncing their schedules and leaving reminders in one centralized place.

Every day many busy families start their day unprepared or unorganized and must rely on old school reminders such as bound calendars and post it notes.  In today’s world of communication and internet it’s important to leverage technology to make our live less stressful in our busy lives.  

Family Hub believes in the five P’s: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.  We have created a Hub for families to not only sync calendars, but have the ability to maintain  to-do/grocery lists, white board notes for each other and know what the weather’s like outside.  With all this information provided in one place (we suggest mounting an older model iPad on your fridge) to get a good idea of how the day will look for the entire family.  

Family Hub’s strength is derived from Google Calendar and Weather.com API’s and powered by React Native, CSS/Bootstrap, Node to provide a single page application hub for your family.

A user simply enters in ther family's Google username and it will load their calendar.  If your family enjoys sharing their calendars they will also populate.  The weather API will request for user to share location for acurate up to date weather displayed on their device.
